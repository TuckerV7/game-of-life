This is Conway's classic game of life.
The game of life is a cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It is a simple 'game'.
It starts with an empty grid of cells. A cell can either be "alive" or "dead". 
If a cell is alive it will be black, if it is dead it will be white.
You choose which cells start alive or dead.
Once the game starts the cells will start to behave in a beautiful and autonomous-like way.
Each cell follows four simple rules.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Have fun!
